# Competitive Matching of Taxis

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a capstone project on optimizing taxi resource allocation in a competitive multi-company environment. The project aims to develop an innovative algorithm that accounts for inter-company competition, enhancing both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in urban transportation systems.

### Key Features

- Data-driven analysis of taxi markets in New York City and Chicago
- Development of a competitive matching algorithm using game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Simulation environment for testing and refining the algorithm
- Comprehensive performance evaluation metrics
